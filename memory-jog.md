When I begin my project by using npx create-react-app can you tell me which files I can immediately delete?

2 / 2

ChatGPT
When you start a new project with npx create-react-app, it scaffolds a project with a lot of boilerplate code and files. While it's set up for immediate development, there are certain files you might not need, depending on the scope of your project. Here's a brief overview of the initial structure and which files you can consider deleting or modifying:


**Files and Folders Created by Create React App**

- node_modules/: Contains all your project's npm dependencies. (Do not delete)
- public/: Holds the static files like index.html, favicon, etc.
- src/: Contains your React component files, CSS, and JavaScript.
- .gitignore: Lists files and folders to be ignored by git.
- package.json: Defines npm dependencies and scripts.
- package-lock.json or yarn.lock: Lock files to ensure consistent installations for your project's dependencies.
- README.md: A markdown file containing information about your project, which you can customize.


**Files You Can Delete or Modify After Scaffold**

1. public/favicon.ico: The React logo favicon. Replace it with your favicon.
2. public/logo192.png and public/logo512.png: React logos used for manifest and should be replaced with your app icons.
3. src/logo.svg: The React logo SVG file. Can be deleted if you're not using it.
4. src/App.test.js: Example test file for App component. Delete it if you're not planning to write tests yet (or if you're using a different testing approach).
5. src/reportWebVitals.js and src/setupTests.js: These files are for reporting web vitals and setting up tests, respectively. If you're not using these features, you can remove them.
6. src/index.css and src/App.css: CSS files for the initial styling. You can modify or delete them, especially if you plan to use a different styling approach (like styled-components or CSS modules).
7. public/manifest.json: Provides metadata used when your web app is added to the homescreen on Android. Modify it to reflect your app's information or delete it if not needed.

**Recommended Steps After Deletion**

- If you delete any files, make sure to remove their imports in your JavaScript files. For example, if you delete logo.svg, remove its import from App.js.
- Modify public/index.html to remove or update links and meta tags that are not relevant to your project.
- Update src/App.js as needed to reflect the structure of your application after removing any of the initial content.

**Caution**

While it's tempting to clean up and remove unnecessary files, ensure you understand the role of each file you're deleting, especially if you're new to React. Some files might seem unnecessary at the beginning but could be useful as your project grows.
